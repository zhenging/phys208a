## Ch. 08 Momentum, Impuls and Collisions

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand how a net impulse on an object affects its momentum, and their integral/derivative relations with net force.
2. Analyze collisions and other interactions for objects and systems, for the cases where total momentum is conserved or not conserved.
3. Demonstrate mastery of applying momentum and energy conservation to analyze systems involving elastic/inelastic/completely inelastic collisions.
4. Demonstrate mastery of applying momentum/energy conservation and components to analyze systems involving two-dimensional collisions.
