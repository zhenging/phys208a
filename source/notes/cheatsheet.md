#### The Kinematic Equations
**Straight-line motion with constant acceleration**
When the x-acceleration is constant, four equations
relate the position $x$ and the x-velocity $v_x$ at any time $t$ to the initial position $x_0$, the initial x-velocity $v _{0x}$ (both measured at time $t = 0$), and the x-acceleration $a_x$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= \frac{v_0 + v_f}{2} \cdot t  \qquad
&v_f &= v_0 + a\cdot t\\
x &= v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \qquad
&v_f^2 &= v_0^2 + 2a\cdot x
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Velocity and Position by Integration
**Straight-line motion with varying acceleration**
When the acceleration is not constant but is a known function of time, we can find the velocity and position as functions of time by integrating the acceleration function.
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_x &= v_{0x} + \int_0^t a_x dt\\
x_x &= x_0 + \int_0^t v_x dt
\end{aligned}
$$
