2. Demonstrate mastery of **scientific notation**, keeping appropriate **significant figures** in calculations, and determining percent discrepancy.
3. Be able to **graphically add/subtract** (two-dimensional) vectors using graph paper and/or a ruler/protractor.
4. Be able to convert between magnitude/direction and $xy$ unit vector components, and master addition/subtraction of vectors using components.
