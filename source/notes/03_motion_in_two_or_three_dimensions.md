### Ch. 03 Motion in Two or Three Dimensions

### Learning Objectives
1. Be able to distinguish between and/or determine (two-dimensional) instantaneous/average velocities, using position vectors, by means of graphical or component vector addition
2. Be able to distinguish between and/or determine (two-dimensional) instantaneous/average accelerations, using velocity vectors, by means of graphical or component vector addition.
3. Be able to calculate 2 and 3 dimensional components of velocity and displacement from acceleration data using integration techniques.
4. Be able to relate the parallel (tangential) and perpendicular (radial) components of acceleration with changes in the direction and speed of the velocity of a particle in curvilinear motion.
5. emonstrate mastery of describing projectile motion.
