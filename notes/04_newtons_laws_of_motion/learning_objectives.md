### Ch. 04 Newton's Laws of Motion

#### Learning Objectives
1. Be able to describe common types of force interactions as vectors; explicitly identifying the two objects that interact.   This involves use of magnitude/direction and component forms; graphical and/or component vector addition to find the net force.
2. Know when and be able to apply Newton's first law to the net force on an object undergoing constant velocity motion.
3. Know when and be able to apply Newton's second law to the net force on an object undergoing constant acceleration motion.
4. Know when and be able to apply Newton's third law in describing a given interaction two different ways, involving the two objects that interact, and how this law "connects" two separate free-body diagrams.
5. Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's laws using free-body diagrams to analyze the behavior/motion of particles.
6. Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's first law to analyze equilibrium situations.
7. Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's second law to analyze dynamic situations.
