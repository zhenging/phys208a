### Ch. 05 Applying Newton's Laws

#### Learning Objectives
1. Be able to describe common types of interactions (_Weight, Force, Tension, Normal forces_) as vectors; explicitly identifying the two objects that interact. This involves use of magnitude/direction and component forms; graphical and/or component vector addition to find the net force.
2. Know when and be able to apply _Newton's first law_ to the net force on an object undergoing constant velocity motion.
3. Know when and be able to apply _Newton's second law_ to the net force on an object undergoing constant acceleration motion.
4. Know when and be able to apply _Newton's third law_ in describing a given interaction two different ways, involving the two objects that interact, and how this law "connects" two separate free-body diagrams.
5. Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's laws using free-body diagrams to analyze the behavior/motion of particles.
6. Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's first law to analyze equilibrium situations.
7. Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's second law to analyze dynamic situations.
8. Understand how _frictional forces_ can be modeled for different situations (kinetic sliding, static sliding, and drag).
9. Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's laws to analyze motion involving frictional/drag forces.
