### Ch. 09 Rotation of Rigid Bodies

#### Learning Objectives
1. Understand how the rotational motion of a (constant angular acceleration) rigid object can be described with angular parameters (in analogy with the linear motion of a constant acceleration object).
2. Be able to analytically or graphically differentiate/integrate to relate angular motion parameters with each other.
3. Understand how linear and angular parameters are related to each other.
4. Understand the vector (right-hand-rule) nature of angular motion parameters, in order to determine their relative +/- sign and ccw/cw directions.
5. Be able to determine the torque ("rotational effectiveness of a force") acting on a rigid object, using a cross-product.
