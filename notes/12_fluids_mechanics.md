### Ch. 12 Fluids Mechanics

#### Learning Objectives
1. Understand how density characterizes different materials and forms of matter.
2. Understand how gauge and absolute pressure is defined for fluids (liquids/gases), and the interpretation of pressure as an "area force density."
3. Understand how the behavior of static fluids is described by Pascal's law ("energy density equalization").
4. Understand how volume conservation ("conservation of incompressible fluid volumes") is applied to simple dynamic fluid flow systems.
5. Demonstrate understanding and mastery of of Bernoulli's equation ("energy density equilization"), along with volume conservation to describing complex dynamic fluid flow systems (with ideally frictionless flow).
