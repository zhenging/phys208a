### Ch. 01 Units, Physical Quantities, and Vectors

#### Learning Objectives
1. Be able to convert between _SI/non-SI units_, and understand how "dimensional analysis" of units is used to check calculations.
2. Demonstrate mastery of _scientific notation_, keeping appropriate _significant figures_ in calculations, and determining percent discrepancy.
3. Be able to _graphically add/subtract_ (two-dimensional) vectors using graph paper and/or a ruler/protractor.
4. Be able to convert between magnitude/direction and $xy$ unit vector components, and master addition/subtraction of vectors using components.

> Reading: Sections 1.1-1.9. We will cover vector multiplication later (1.10)

+ Problem-Solving Strategy (**ISEE**, _Identify_, _Set Up_, _Execute_, _Evaluate_)
+ International System and the British System (Time, Length, Mass, Unit Prefixes)
+ Uncertainty and significant figures
  * Significant figures
  + the thickness of a book is 2.91 mm. (3 significant figures, the uncertainty is about 0.01 mm)
  + A distance given as 0.250 km. (3 significant figures, the uncertainty is 0.001 km)
+ Vectors and Vector Addition
  * scalar quantity - single number
  * vector quantity - magnitude and direction
    + parallel  - same direction and magnitude
    + negative of a vector - ($-\vec A$)
    + anti-parallel - opposite direction and same magnitude
    + magnitude of $\vec{A} = A = |\vec{A}|$
