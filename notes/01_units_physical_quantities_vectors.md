## Ch. 01 Units, Physical Quantities, and Vectors

### Learning Objectives
1. Be able to convert between **SI/non-SI units**, and understand how "dimensional analysis" of units is used to check calculations.
2. Demonstrate mastery of **scientific notation**, keeping appropriate **significant figures** in calculations, and determining percent discrepancy.
3. Be able to **graphically add/subtract** (two-dimensional) vectors using graph paper and/or a ruler/protractor.
4. Be able to convert between magnitude/direction and $xy$ unit vector components, and master addition/subtraction of vectors using components.

>_Reading_: sections 1.1-1.9. We will cover vector multiplication later (1.10)
_Homework_: Ch. 01
_Exercises_: 2, 3, 4, 7, 20, 28, 30, 34, 37, 38, 39

#### 1.1 The Nature of Physics

#### 1.2 Solving Physics Problems
##### Problem-Solving Strategy 1.1
* **Identify** the relevant concepts
* **Set** up the problem: the concepts, the **known** quantities, the **target** variables, the equation to chooose, draw a sketch
* **Execute** the solution: Do the math
* **Evaluate** your answer: Compare your answer with your estimates, and reconsider things if thereâ€™s a discrepancy.

#### 1.3 Standard and Units
International System and the British System

* Time
* Length
* Mass
* Unit Prefixes

#### 1.4 Using and Converting Units
An equation must always be **dimensionally consistent**.

#### 1.5 Uncertainty and significant figures
* Uncertainty (error)
* Accuracy
	+ $56.47 \pm0.02mm$
    + $1.6454(21)$ means $1.6454 \pm 0.0021$
    + *fractional error* or *percent error* - $47ohms \pm 10\%$
  * Significant figures
    + the thickness of a book is 2.91 mm. (3 significant figures, the uncertainty is about 0.01 mm)
   + A distance given as 0.250 km. (3 significant figures, the uncertainty is 0.001 km)
  * Scientific notation  - powers-of-10 notation
  * Precision

#### 1.6 Estimates and Orders of Magnitude

#### 1.7 Vectors and Vector Addition

* scalar quantity - single number
* vector quantity - magnitude and direction
  + parallel  - same direction and magnitude
  + negative of a vector - ($-\vec A$)
  + anti-parallel - opposite direction and same magnitude
  + magnitude of $\vec{A} = A = |\vec{A}|$

  ##### Vectors Addition and Subtraction
