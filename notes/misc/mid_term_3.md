### Mid Term 3

(10) At time $t=0$, a wheel has an initial angular velocity $\omega_0 = 2$ rad/s. The wheel is experiencing an angular acceleration $\alpha = 3t$ for 3 seconds. Find the final angular velocity.
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
\omega_f &= \omega_0 + \int_0^3 3t dt\\
&= 2.0 + \frac{3}{2}t^2\mid_0^3\\
&= 2.0 + (13.5 - 0) = 15.5 rad/s
\end{aligned}
$$
