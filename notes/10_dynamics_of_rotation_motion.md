### Ch. 10 Dynamics of Rotation Motion

#### Learning Objectives
1. Understand how rotational kinetic energy ($K_{rot}$) of an object is defined, and how it is changed by work (torque-angular displacement form) done on/by the object.
2. Demonstrate mastery of applying energy conservation to analyze complex translational/rotational systems involving conservative/non-conservative forces/torques.
3. Understand how the parallel-axis theorem is used to relate different moments of inertia about different axes of rotation about the same object.
4. Understand how angular momentum of an object is defined, and how it is changed by an angular impulse exerted on it (integral and differential relations).
5. Demonstrate mastery of applying angular momentum conservation to analyze complex systems involving elastic/inelastic collisions involving translational/rotational objects.
