<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<ol>
<li>Be able to describe common types of interactions (<em>Weight, Force, Tension, Normal forces</em>) as vectors; explicitly identifying the two objects that interact. This involves use of magnitude/direction and component forms; graphical and/or component vector addition to find the net force.</li>
<li>Know when and be able to apply <em>Newton's first law</em> to the net force on an object undergoing constant velocity motion.</li>
<li>Know when and be able to apply <em>Newton's second law</em> to the net force on an object undergoing constant acceleration motion.</li>
<li>Know when and be able to apply <em>Newton's third law</em> in describing a given interaction two different ways, involving the two objects that interact, and how this law &quot;connects&quot; two separate free-body diagrams.</li>
<li>Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's laws using free-body diagrams to analyze the behavior/motion of particles.</li>
<li>Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's first law to analyze equilibrium situations.</li>
<li>Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's second law to analyze dynamic situations.</li>
<li>Understand how <em>frictional forces</em> can be modeled for different situations (kinetic sliding, static sliding, and drag).</li>
<li>Demonstrate mastery of applying Newton's laws to analyze motion involving frictional/drag forces.</li>
</ol>
