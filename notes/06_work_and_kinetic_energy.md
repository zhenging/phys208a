Ch. 06 Work and Kinetic Energy
Ch. 07 Potential Energy and Energy Conservation

### Learning Objectives
1. Be able to identify and quantitatively model **closed** mechanical energy systems (where mechanical energy is **conserved** or no external work is done).
2. Be able to quantify work as the transfer of energy to/from a mechanical energy system, due to a (constant/non-constant) force acting over a displacement.
3. Be able to identify and quantitatively model **open** mechanical energy systems (where mechanical energy is not "conserved" or work is done by external forces). Also be able to distinguish between conservative and non-conservative (**lossy**) forces.
4. Understand how power quantifies the time rate of energy transfer or change, and model time-dependent processes.
5. Understand the intergral/differential relations between conservative forces and potential energies, and how conservative forces and energy conservation can be **read** off of a potential energy versus position graph (**energy diagram**).
6. Model the behavior of mass-spring systems with **energy diagrams** (potential energy versus position graphs).
7. Model the behavior of masses in gravitational wells with **energy diagrams** (potential energy versus position graphs).
