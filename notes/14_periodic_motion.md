### Ch. 14 Periodic Motion

#### Learning Objectives
1. Understand the basic features of simple harmonic motion, including frequency, amplitude, period, and the restoring force that makes simple harmonic motion possible.
2. Be able to calculate the angular frequency of motion for a mass-spring system, simple pendulum, and physical pendulum
3. Understand how the pivot point for the physical pendulum requires knowledge of the _parallel axis theorem_.
4. Be able to calculate displacement (or angle), velocity, acceleration, and energy for an object executing simple harmonic motion.
