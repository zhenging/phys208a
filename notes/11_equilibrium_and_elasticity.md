### Ch. 11 Equilibrium and Elasticity

#### Learning Objectives
1. Demonstrate mastery in calculating the net torque on an object, from an "extended" free-body diagram.
2. Demonstrate mastery of determining the appropriate "moment-of-inertia" of an object, given its mass and geometry.   (The "parallel-axis theorem" will be covered in the Quiz 9 learning goals.)
3. Demonstrate mastery of applying translational and rotational forms of Newton's laws to analyze fixed-axis rotation systems.
4. Demonstrate mastery of applying translational and rotational forms of Newton's laws to analyze moving-axis rotation systems.
5. Demonstrate mastery of applying translational and rotational forms of Newton's first laws to analyze static systems.
