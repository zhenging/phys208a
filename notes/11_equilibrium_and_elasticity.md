### Ch. 11 Equilibrium and Elasticity

#### Learning Objectives
1. Demonstrate mastery in calculating the net torque on an object, from an "extended" free-body diagram.
2. Demonstrate mastery of determining the appropriate "moment-of-inertia" of an object, given its mass and geometry.   (The "parallel-axis theorem" will be covered in the Quiz 9 learning goals.)
3. Demonstrate mastery of applying translational and rotational forms of Newton's laws to analyze fixed-axis rotation systems.
4. Demonstrate mastery of applying translational and rotational forms of Newton's laws to analyze moving-axis rotation systems.
5. Demonstrate mastery of applying translational and rotational forms of Newton's first laws to analyze static systems.

x = 2.4m

(11.8) A 50.0-cm, uniform, 50.0-N shelf is supported horizontally by two vertical wires attached to the sloping ceiling (the figure (Figure 1)). A very small 17.0-N tool is placed on the shelf midway between the points where the wires are attached to it.

b. Find the tension in righ wire.

b. $T_R = 50.2N$

(11.10) A uniform ladder 5.0 m long rests against a frictionless, vertical wall with its lower end 3.0 m from the wall. The ladder weighs 160 N. The coefficient of static friction between the foot of the ladder and the ground is 0.40. A man weighing 740 N climbs slowly up the ladder.
a. What is the maximum frictional force that the ground can exert on the ladder at its lower end?
b. What is the actual frictional force when the man has climbed 1.0 m along the ladder?
c. How far along the ladder can the man climb before the ladder starts to slip?

a. $F_s = 360N$
b. $F_s = 171N$
c. $s = 2.7m$

(11.12) A uniform, aluminum beam 9.00 m long, weighting 300 N, rests symmetrically on two supports 5.00 m apart. A boy weighing 600 N starts at point A and walks toward the right.
a. How far beyond point B can the boy walk before the beam tips?
b. How far from the right end of the beam should support B be placed so that the boy can walk just to the end of the beam without causing it to tip?

>Solution
Let $C$ be the center of mass of the beam and $P$ be the pivot point. Just before the beam tips, the normal force at $A$ is zero and normal force at $B$ is the total weight of the beam and the boy.
a.  Let $BD = x$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
m_{beam}\cdot g \cdot CP + m_{boy}\cdot g &= F_B \cdot 2\\
300 \cdot \frac{9}{2} + 600 \cdot (2-x) &= (300 + 600) \cdot 2\\
\To & x=1.25m
\end{aligned}
$$
b. Let $BP = x$
$$
\begin{aligned}
m_{beam}\cdot g \cdot CP &= F_B \cdot BP\\
300 \cdot \frac{9}{2} & = (300 + 600) x\\
\To & x=1.5m
\end{aligned}
