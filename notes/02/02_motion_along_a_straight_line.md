### Ch. 02 Motion Along a Straright Line

#### Learning Objectives
1. Be able to calculate acceleration (_slope_) and position (_area_) graphically from a velocity versus time graph.
2. Be able to distinguish between and/or determine (one-dimensional) speed, and instantaneous/average velocities.
3. Be able to distinguish between and/or determine (one-dimensional) instantaneous/average accelerations.
4. Be able to differentiate/integrate to relate (one-dimensional) translational motion parameters and graphs with each other.
5. Demonstrate mastery of eliminating variables, back-substitution, and/or use of the quadratic formula in quantitatively modeling the constant (one-dimensional) acceleration motion of an object.
