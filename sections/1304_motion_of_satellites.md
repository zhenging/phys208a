#### Exercises
20, 23, 25

(13.20) An earth satellite moves in a circular orbit with an orbital speed of $6200 m/s$. Find
(a) the time of one revolution of the satellite;
(b) the radial acceleration of the satellite in its orbit.

(13.23) Two satellites are in circular orbits around a planet that has radius $9.00 \times 10^6m$. One satellite has mass $68.0 kg$, orbital radius $7.00 \times 10^7 m$, and orbital speed $4800 m/s$. The second sat ellite has mass $84.0 kg$ and orbital radius $3.00 \times 10^7 m$. What is the orbital speed of this second satellite?

(13.25) Deimos, a moon of Mars, is about 12 km in diameter with mass $1.5 \times 10^{15} kg$. Suppose you are stranded alone on Deimos and want to play a one-person game of baseball. You would be the pitcher, and you would be the batter!
(a) With what speed would you have to throw a baseball so that it would go into a circular orbit just above the surface and return to you so you could hit it? Do you think you could actually throw it at this speed?
(b) How long (in hours) after throwing the ball should you be ready to hit it? Would this be an action-packed baseball game?
