### 1304 The Motion of Satellites

#### Satellites: Circular orbits
By the law of gravitation, the net force on the satellite of mass m has magnitude $F_g = Gm_Em/r^2$, and is in the same direction as the acceleration. Newton's second law then tells us that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{Gm_e m}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} \quad &\text{(1)}
\end{aligned}
$$
Solving this for $v$, we finding
$$
\begin{aligned}
v = \sqrt{\frac{Gm_E}{r}} \quad &\text{(2)}
\end{aligned}
$$
The speed $v$ is the distance $2\pi r$ traveld in one revolution, divided by the period
$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= \frac{2\pi r}{T}\\
\To T&= \frac{2\pi r}{v}
\end{aligned}
$$
The total mechanical energy can be determined as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
E &= K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + (-\frac{Gm_E m}{r})\\
&= \frac{1}{2}m(\frac{Gm_E m}{r}) + (-\frac{Gm_E m}{r})\\
&= -\frac{Gm_E m}{2r} \quad &\text{(3)}
\end{aligned}
$$

(13.20) An earth satellite moves in a circular orbit with an orbital speed of 6200 m/s. Find (a) the time of one revolution of the satellite; (b) the radial acceleration of the satellite in its orbit.
>Solution
Let the period $T$ and the radial acceleration be $a$, we first calculate the radius of the orbit $r$,
$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{Gm_E}{r}}\\
\To r &= \frac{Gm_E}{v^2}\\
&= \frac{G \cdot 5.97 \cdot 10^{24}}{6200^2}\\
&= 10358975m\\
T &= \frac{2\pi r}{v}\\
&= \frac{2\pi \cdot 10358975}{6200} = 10498s = 175min\\
a &= \frac{v^2}{r}\\
&= \frac{6200^2}{10358975} = 3.71m/s^2
\end{aligned}
$$

(13.23) Two satellites are in circular orbits around a planet that has radius $9.00 \times 10^6m$. One satellite has mass 68.0 kg, orbital radius $7.00 \times 10^7 m$, and orbital speed 4800 m/s. The second sat ellite has mass 84.0 kg and orbital radius $3.00 \times 10^7 m$. What is the orbital speed of this second satellite?
>Solution
Todo
$v_2 = 7332m/s$

(13.24) **International Space Station**. In its orbit each day, the International Space Station makes 15.65 revolutions around the earth. Assuming a circular orbit, how high is this satellite above the surface of the earth?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
T &= \frac{24 \cdot 3600}{15.65} = 5520.8s\\
v &= \sqrt{2\pi r}{T} = \sqrt{\frac{Gm_e}{r}}\\
\To r &= \sqrt[3]{GM\cdot\left(\frac{T}{2\pi}\right)^2}\\
&= \sqrt[3]{6.67\cdot 10^{-11} \cdot 5.97 \cdot 10^{24}\cdot\left(\frac{5520.8}{2\pi}\right)^2}\\
&= 6749108.5m\\
h & = r - R_E \\
&= 6749108.5 - 6.37 \cdot 10^6 = 379108.5m \approx 380km
\end{aligned}
$$
The hight above the surface earth is approximately 380km.

(13.25) Deimos, a moon of Mars, is about 12 km in diameter with mass $1.5 \times 10^{15} kg$. Suppose you are stranded alone on Deimos and want to play a one-person game of baseball. You would be the pitcher, and you would be the batter!
(a) With what speed would you have to throw a baseball so that it would go into a circular orbit just above the surface and return to you so you could hit it? Do you think you could actually throw it at this speed?
(b) How long (in hours) after throwing the ball should you be ready to hit it? Would this be an action-packed baseball game?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{Gm}{R}}\\
&= \sqrt{\frac{6.67\cdot 10^{-11} \cdot 1.5 \cdot 10^{15}}{6000}} = 4.1m/s\\
T &= \frac{2\pi R}{v}\\
&= \frac{2\pi \cdot 6000}{4.1} \approx 2.6h
\end{aligned}
$$

An object is projected vertically upward from the surface of a nonrotating planet of radius $R$, with an initial velocity equal to 48% of the escape velocity for the planet. THe maximum distance from the center of the planet attained by the object is closed to
>Solution
