### 0804 Elastic Collision
Collision in whichbodies collide and seperate, the velocties are exchanged if purely elastic, where both $\vec P$ and $KE$ are conserved. Examples: _billizard balls_.
For any two masses, $m_1, m_2$. Let the momentum before and after collision be $\vec P_i$ and $\vec P_f$, the kinetic energy before and after collision be $KE_i$ and $KE_f$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\vec P_i &= \vec P_f\\
m_1v_{1i} + m_2v_{2i} &= m_1v_{1f} + m_2v_{2f}\\
KE_i &= KE_f\\
\frac{1}{2}m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_{2i}^2 &= \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_{2i}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_{2f}^2\\
\Downarrow\\
v_{1f} &= \frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2} \cdot v_{1i}\ + \frac{2m_2}{m_1+m_2}\cdot v_{2i} \\
v_{2f} &= \frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}\cdot v_{1i} + \frac{m_2-m_1}{m_1+m_2}\cdot v_{2i}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Exercises
(8.46) A $0.152 kg$ glider is moving to the right on a frictionless, horizontal air track with a speed of $0.830 m/s$. It has a head-on collision with a $0.307 kg$ glider that is moving to the left with a speed of $2.30 m/s$. Suppose the collision is elastic.
(a) Find the magnitude and direction of the final velocity of the $0.152 kg$ glider.
(b) Find the magnitude and direction of the final velocity of the 0.307 kg glider.

(8.48) A $10.0 g$ marble slides to the left with a velocity of magnitude $0.400 m/s$ on the frictionless, horizontal surface of an icy New York sidewalk and has a head-on, **elastic collision** with a larger $30.0 g$ marble sliding to the right with a velocity of magnitude $0.200 m/s$. Let $+x$ be to the right. (Since the collision is head-on, all the motion is along a line.)
