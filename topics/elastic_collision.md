8.46 A $0.152 kg$ glider is moving to the right on a frictionless, horizontal air track with a speed of $0.830 m/s$. It has a head-on collision with a $0.307 kg$ glider that is moving to the left with a speed of $2.30 m/s$. Suppose the collision is elastic.
(a) Find the magnitude and direction of the final velocity of the $0.152 kg$ glider.
(b) Find the magnitude and direction of the final velocity of the 0.307 kg glider.

8.48 A $10.0 g$ marble slides to the left with a velocity of magnitude $0.400 m/s$ on the frictionless, horizontal surface of an icy New York sidewalk and has a head-on, **elastic collision** with a larger $30.0 g$ marble sliding to the right with a velocity of magnitude $0.200 m/s$. Let $+x$ be to the right. (Since the collision is head-on, all the motion is along a line.)
