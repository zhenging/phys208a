### Fluid Flow

#### Examples
(12.6) Incompressible oil of density $850 kg/m^3$ is pumped through a cylindrical pipe at a rate of 9.5 liters per second.
(a) The first section of the pipe has a diameter of 8.0 cm. What is the flow speed of the oil? What is the mass flow rate?
(b) The second section of the pipe has a diameter of 4.0 cm. What are the flow speed and mass flow rate in that section?
