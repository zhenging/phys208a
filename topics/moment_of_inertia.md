#### Exercises
(10.9) The flywheel of an engine has moment of inertia _$1.30 kg \cdot m^2$_ about its rotation axis. What constant torque is required to bring it up to an angular speed of _400 rev/min_ in _8.00 s_, starting from rest?
>Solution
$6.81N\cdot m$

(10.10) A cord is wrapped around the rim of a solid uniform wheel 0.250 m in radius and of mass 9.20 kg. A steady horizontal pull of 38.0 N to the right is exerted on the cord, pulling it off tangentially from the wheel. The wheel is mounted on frictionless bearings on a horizontal axle through its center.
a. Compute the angular acceleration of the wheel.
b. Compute the acceleration of the part of the cord that has already been pulled off the wheel.
c. Find the magnitude of the force that the axle exerts on the wheel.
d. Find the direction of the force that the axle exerts on the wheel.

(10.24) A uniform marble rolls down a symmetric bowl, starting from rest at the top of the left side. The top of each side is a distance h above the bottom of the bowl. The left half of the bowl is rough enough to cause the marble to roll without slipping, but the right half has no friction because it is coated with oil.
