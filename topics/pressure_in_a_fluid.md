### Pressure In a Fluid

#### Exercises
(12.9) Oceans on Mars. Scientists have found evidence that Mars may once have had an ocean 0.500 km deep. The acceleration due to gravity on Mars is $3.71 m/s^2$.
a. What would be the gauge pressure at the bottom of such an ocean, assuming it was freshwater?
b. To what depth would you need to go in the earth's ocean to experience the same gauge pressure?
>Solution


(12.30) You are preparing some apparatus for a visit to a newly discovered planet Caasi having oceans of glycerine and a surface acceleration due to gravity of $5.40 m/s^2$. If your apparatus floats in the oceans on earth with 34.0 % of its volume submerged, what percentage will be submerged in the glycerine oceans of Caasi?
