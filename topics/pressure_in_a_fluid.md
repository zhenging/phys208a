### Pressure In a Fluid
We define the **pressure** $p$ at that point as the normal force per unit area - that is, the ratio of $dF_{\perp}$ to $dA$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p = \frac{dF_{\perp}}{dA}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $p$ is the pressure at a point in a fluid, $dF_{\perp}$ is the normal force exerted by the fluid on a small surface at that point, and $dA$ is the area of the surface.

+ Atmospheric pressure $p_a = 1 \text{atm} = 1.013 \times 10^5 Pa$

#### Exercises
(12.9) Oceans on Mars. Scientists have found evidence that Mars may once have had an ocean 0.500 km deep. The acceleration due to gravity on Mars is $3.71 m/s^2$.
a. What would be the gauge pressure at the bottom of such an ocean, assuming it was freshwater?
b. To what depth would you need to go in the earth's ocean to experience the same gauge pressure?
>Solution
a. $1.86 \times 10^6 Pa$
b. 184m

(12.21) A cylindrical disk of Figure e12.21 wood weighing 45.0 N and having a diameter of 30.0 cm floats on a cylinder of oil of density $0.850 g/cm^3$ (Fig. E12.21). The disk cylinder of oil is 75.0 cm deep and has a diameter the same as that of the wood.
(a) What is the gauge pressure at the top of the oil column?
(b) Suppose now that someone puts a weight of 83.0 N on top of the wood, but no oil seeps around the edge of the wood. What is the change in pressure at (i) the bottom of the oil and (ii) halfway down in the oil?
>Solution
a. 636Pa
b. i) 1170Pa ii) 1170Pa
