$$
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{R}
$$

A car is moving along an inclined _frictionless_ circular track. The inclined angle with the horizontal line is $\th = 30\degree$ The radius of the track is $100m$. Find the velocity $v$, so that the car does not move up or down.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tan \th &= \frac{F_c}{W}\\
\tan 30\degree &= \frac{\frac{mv^2}{R}}{mg}\\
\To v &= \sqrt {gR\tan 30\degree}\\
&= \sqrt {9.8 \times 100 \times \frac{1}{2}} \approx 23.8m/s
\end{aligned}
$$
