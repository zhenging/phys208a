### Simple Harmonic Motion
Todo


#### Exercises
(14.16) A small block is attached to an ideal spring and is moving in SHM on a horizontal, frictionless surface. When the amplitude of the motion is 0.090 m, it takes the block 2.43 s to travel from x= 0.090 m to x= -0.090 m.
a. If the amplitude is doubled, to 0.180 m , how long does it take the block to travel from x= 0.180 m to x= -0.180 m?
b. If the amplitude is doubled, to 0.180 m , how long does it take the block to travel from x= 0.090 m to x= -0.090 m ?
>Solution
a. $t=2.43s$
b. $\Delta t = 0.81s = \dfrac{2.43 \times 2}{6}s$
