8.16 A $64.5 kg$ astronaut is doing a repair in space on the orbiting space station. She throws a $2.35 kg$ tool away from her at $3.50 m/s$ relative to the space station. Find the speed and direction she begin to move.
>Solution
**Identify**: Conservation of Momentum
**Setup**: Let the mass of the astronaut be $m_1$, and the mass of the tool be $m_2$. Without external force, the total momentum is zero before and after she throws the tool. Let the direction of motion of the astronaut be positive. $v_2=-3.5m/s$
$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\
\To & v_1 = -\frac{m_2 v_2}{m_1}\\
&= -\frac{2.35 \times (-3.5)}{64.5} \approx 0.128m/s
\end{aligned}
$$
She will move **opposite** to the direction in which she throws the tool.
