### Newton's Law of Gravitation

>Definition
Every particle of matter in the universe attracks every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distant between them.
$$
\begin{aligned}
F_g = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $G$ is the Gravitational constant and $r$ is the distance between particles.

#### Exercises
Earth orbits sun at $R = 150$ million km and travels $93$ million miles in 1 year($3.1\times 10^7s$). Calculate the mass of the sun.
>Solution
The attraction between Earth and Sun is the centripetal force that forces Earth to orbit.
$$
\begin{aligned}
F_g &= F_c\\
\frac{Gm_em_s}{R^2} &= \frac{m_ev_e^2}{r}\\
\To & v_e = \sqrt {\frac{Gm_s}{R}} &\text{(Eq 1)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
As Earth travels $93$ million miles in 1 year($3.1\times 10^7s$)
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_e &= \frac{2\pi R}{t} &\text{(Eq 2}
\end{aligned}
$$
Combine Eq 1 and 2, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
(R &= 1.5 \times 10^{11}m \quad G= 6.67 \times 10^{-11}m^3/kg\cdot s^2 \quad t=3.1\times 10^7s)\\
m_s &= \frac{4\pi^2 R^3}{Gt^2}\\
&=\frac{4\pi^2 \cdot (1.5\times 10^{11})^3}{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times (3.1 \times 10^7)^2}\\
&= 2.08 \times 10^{30}kg
\end{aligned}
$$
