### Buoyancy

**Archimedes's principLe**: When a body is completely or partially immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the body equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.

#### Exercises
(12.26) A rock has mass 1.80 kg. When the rock is suspended from the lower end of a string and totally immersed in water, the tension in the string is 12.8 N. What is the smallest density of a liquid in which the rock will float?
>Solution
Todo

(12.28) A slab of ice floats on a freshwater lake. What minimum volume must the slab have for a 65.0-kg woman to be able to stand on it without getting her feet wet?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
m_{ice} g+ m_{w}g & = \rho_{water} v_{sub} g\\
\rho_{ice} v_{ice} g+ m_{w}g & = \rho_{water} v_{sub} g\\
v_{ice} &= v_{sub}\\
\To v_{ice} &= \frac{m_{w}}{\rho_{water} - \rho_{ice}}\\
&= \frac{65}{1000-920} = 0.8m^3
\end{aligned}
$$

(12.30) You are preparing some apparatus for a visit to a newly discovered planet Caasi having oceans of glycerine and a surface acceleration due to gravity of $5.40 m/s^2$. If your apparatus floats in the oceans on earth with 34.0 % of its volume submerged, what percentage will be submerged in the glycerine oceans of Caasi?
>Solution
On Earth
$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho_{object} V_{object} g &= \rho_{ocean} V_{sub} g\\
\To \rho_{object} &= \frac{V_{sub}}{V_{object}} \cdot \rho_{ocean}\\
& = 0.34 \cdot 1030 kg/m^3
\end{aligned}
$$
On Mars
$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho_{object} V_{object} g &= \rho_{glycerine} V_{sub} g\\
\frac{V_{sub}}{V_{object}} &= \frac{\rho_{object}}{\rho_{glycerine}}\\
&= \frac{0.34 \cdot 1030}{1260} = 27.8\%
\end{aligned}
$$
