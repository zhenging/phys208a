### Buoyancy

#### Exercises
(12.26) A rock has mass 1.80 kg. When the rock is suspended from the lower end of a string and totally immersed in water, the tension in the string is 12.8 N. What is the smallest density of a liquid in which the rock will float?

(12.28) A slab of ice floats on a freshwater lake. What minimum volume must the slab have for a 65.0-kg woman to be able to stand on it without getting her feet wet?

(12.30) You are preparing some apparatus for a visit to a newly discovered planet Caasi having oceans of glycerine and a surface acceleration due to gravity of $5.40 m/s^2$. If your apparatus floats in the oceans on earth with 34.0 % of its volume submerged, what percentage will be submerged in the glycerine oceans of Caasi?
